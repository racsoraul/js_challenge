# JS Challenge

This repository was created due to a Focus code JS Challenge.

An online demo has been deployed: https://racsoraul.github.io/js_challenge/.

And there is also a CodePen project: https://codepen.io/racsoraul/project/editor/XMppxr

> **NOTE:** There were CORS issues with the `genderize` API, that's why I didn't *genderize* the avatars.

## Running locally
You may clone this repository and run it with any http server you want. One easy way can be by using the `http-server` npm package by executing the following at the root of this project:

```
npx http-server -p 3000 --cors
```
